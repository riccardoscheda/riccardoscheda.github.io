At the AI for Medicine Research Group, we are dedicated to advancing the field of precision medicine through the use of artificial intelligence. Collaboration is essential to make progress in this field, which is why we provide on [our GitHub page](https://github.com/Imaging-AI-for-Health-virtual-lab) the open-source code associated with our publications. We invite you to explore our tools and hope they will inspire your own research. If you're interested in collaborating with us, please don't hesitate to contact us at the email address provided on our website.

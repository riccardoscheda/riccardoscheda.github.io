We are looking for motivated students interested in the intersection of computer science, vision,
and health.

PhD applicants may apply through Johns Hopkins graduate admissions, being sure to note Mathias
Unberath as their primary faculty member of interest.

Postdoctoral applicants, masters students, and undergraduates should reach out to Prof. Unberath
directly, being sure to include area of interest, time frame, and the type of work (Masters thesis,
general research, etc). Applicants may wish to identify a PhD student whose interests align with
theirs, who could supervise.
